# Hong Kong Tour 

**Time:** 2024.1.20 - 2024.1.23 

## Preface

It was my inaugural visit to Hong Kong, a prominent economic hub in China celebrated for its financial prowess. Despite our brief stay of just 3 days, it provided ample opportunity to explore the city. In Hong Kong, the emphasis lies not so much on seeking picturesque landscapes, but rather on immersing oneself in its urban attractions and cityscape.

HK is a small city compared with other cities in Mainland China, and it will take at most no less than an hour to travel from one scenic spot to another. There are something interesting or some differences compared with Mainland China. 

1. The consumption level is higher than Mainland China, double the price of Hangzhou. 
2. There are a lot of skyscrapers, and the construction is quite similar to Chongqing, which means even if you were at 12th floor, you may regard it as the ground floor. 
3. Cause HK was once ruled by Britain, many British things still remains. Like driving on the left, British-style meals, counting from the ground floor. 
4. Fast-paced life: people there always walk fast, and the escalators also go fast. 
5. And what struck me a lot was the overall quality of people there. When people was taking the escalator, they always went on the right side, and vacated the left side for emergency use. Also, almost everyone in HK knows English and can speak it quite well. Even the clients or the students can handle it really well. 

**Advice: ** It's a good idea to book your hotel far from the city center, so that your room will be bigger and cheaper, but please pay special attention that your hotel location should be close to the underground station. Here are some noteworthy scenic spots worth considering during your stay: Victoria Peak, Victoria Harbour, and The University of Hong Kong.

## Schedule 

### Day1 

We took the flight in the early morning, from Hangzhou to Shenzhen. Then, we took the high speed train to HK. It's cheaper to buy the separate tickets than directly flying to HK.  

Initially, our plan was to leisurely explore the city in the afternoon. However, we ultimately decided to visit **HKU(香港大学)**. Given our accommodation in **Tsim Sha Tsui(尖沙咀)**, we chose to take a scenic stroll to HKU, allowing us to simultaneously experience the city's charm along the way.

Luckily, we took the cruise to travel to the opposite island, and we can enjoy the beautiful sights here.

HKU is built on the mountain. While wandering around, we unexpectedly found ourselves lost, cause we failed to get to the destination due to the vertical structure of the campus design. Well, personally, I love this kind of structure, for every floor, you will find something new and exciting. Compared with **CUHK(香港中文大学)**, which is quite normal occupying a large area, I prefer the HKU.

    <tr>       
        <td><img src="pics\HKU1.jpg"></td>       
        <td><img src="pics\HKU2.jpg"></td>     
    </tr>     
    <tr>       
        <td><img src="pics\HKU3.jpg"></td>       
        <td><img src="pics\HKU4.jpg"></td>     
    </tr>   
</table>

Subsequently, we returned to **Yau Tsim Mong District(油尖旺区)**, often referred to as the city center of Hong Kong. Renowned for its bustling atmosphere, this district is a prime destination for shopping enthusiasts. If you're eager to immerse yourself in the economic allure of Hong Kong, this area is a must-visit.

### Day2

Breakfast time! We had the traditional HK morning tea at **Tao Heung(稻香)**. The food is delicious and you can really feel about the morning tea atmosphere there. But the service was a little bit bad(maybe only bad to tourists from Mainland China). 

<img src="pics\daoxiang.jpg" alt="Tao Heung" width="60%" height="60%">

After meal, we went to **West Kowloon(西九龙)**, which is the culture center of HK. We visited **M+ museum** and **Hong Kong Palace Museum(香港故宫文化博物馆)**. M+ museum is mainly for modern arts, and Hong Kong Palace Museum is mainly for past history exhibition(exhibits Ming, Qing dynasty). 

To be honest, I am more fond of the M+ museum, cause I have seen hundreds of exhibitions related to China's history, and you can see it everywhere in Mainland China(even every city has one). So it's much more interesting for me to going through the M+ museum. 

<table>     
    <tr>       
        <td><img src="pics\museum1.jpg"></td>       
        <td><img src="pics\museum2.jpg"></td>     
    </tr>     
    <tr>       
        <td><img src="pics\museum3.jpg"></td>       
        <td><img src="pics\museum4.jpg"></td>     
    </tr>   
</table>

Another shopping time! We again went to the Yau Tsim Mong District. 

### Day3 

McDonald for breakfast. Then, we went to **The Chinese University of Hong Kong(香港中文大学)**. It's located in the remote area, and is far from the city center. The campus is large(at least compared with HKU), but there is still a huge mountain existing in the campus. 

<table>     
    <tr>       
        <td><img src="pics\CUHK1.jpg"></td>       
        <td><img src="pics\CUHK2.jpg"></td>     
    </tr>     
    <tr>       
        <td><img src="pics\CUHK3.jpg"></td>       
        <td><img src="pics\CUHK4.jpg"></td>     
    </tr>   
</table>

The most beautiful sight in CUHK is the **Pavilion of Harmony(合一亭)**. If you happened to visit CUHK, please do not forget to go there. It's next to the students' dormitory, and it can definitely impress you a lot! 

<table>     
    <tr>       
        <td><img src="pics\PoH1.jpg"></td>       
        <td><img src="pics\PoH2.jpg"></td>     
    </tr>      
</table>

Returning once more to Yau Tsim Mong District, it turned out to be quite amusing that we devoted a significant portion of our time to shopping. But I was at that time that I bought my Fujifilm Instax Mini Evo(quite hard to buy it in Mainland China). 

Later, we headed to **Causeway Bay(铜锣湾)** for albums, though unfortunately, our quest was in vain. 

At night, we went to the **Avenue of Stars(星光大道)** and **Victoria Harbour(维多利亚港)** to see the night view.

## Scenic Spots

### Yau Tsim Mong District(油尖旺区)

Composed of **Tsim Sha Tsui(尖沙咀)**, **Yau Ma Tei(油麻地)** and **Mong Kok(旺角)**. 

The main shopping center of HK. If you want to go shopping, or experience the HK city life, you can't miss it. 

### The University of Hong Kong(香港大学)

The most famous university in HK, not bad for visiting. 

### The Chinese University of Hong Kong(香港中文大学)

**Pavilion of Harmony(合一亭)** is quite beautiful, but except for it, actually there is no need to visit. 

If you have already visited HKU, you don't need to go there. 

But if you are fond of CUHK, well, then do it. 

### Avenue of Stars(星光大道)

Close to the river, good for seeing the night view. 

### Victoria Harbour(维多利亚港)

Close to the river, also good for its night view. 

### M+ museum

Mainly for modern arts. A very good place to relax and visit, it has the **sky garden(空中花园)** and you can have a great view there. 

### Hong Kong Palace Museum(香港故宫文化博物馆)

Exhibition for old China. Quite common in Mainland China. 

### Victoria Peak(太平山顶)

A great place to see the night view and overlook the whole HK city. You can also see the beautiful sunset there. 

Quite crowded!

### Braemar Hill(宝马山)

The substitute for Victoria Peak, less people. 

The facilities are not complete, may be dangerous. It will be totally dark if in the night, so you'd better get down before sunset. 

### Harbour City(海港城)

A shopping center near river. A great place for shopping and sightseeing.
