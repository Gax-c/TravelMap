# Shenzhen Tour

**Time: **2024.1.23 - 2024.1.24 

## Preface 

It can be called a short trip to tour Shenzhen. At first we were not going to Shenzhen, but spent more time in Hong Kong. However, we found 3 days was enough for our HK tour. So, as a result, we decided to spend 1 day in Shenzhen, and to "skim" the city. 

Shenzhen is the first city in China to start reform and opening up, and is also China's special economic zone. So, maybe due to this, Shenzhen is not a city suitable for travel. There are not many tourist attractions in Shenzhen. So, in other hand, 1 day is also enough for the trip. 

The most impressive thing is that **commodity prices in Shenzhen is surprisingly low, even lower than Hangzhou**, contrary to its economical power.   

## Schedule 

### Day1

Although it's called "Day1", but actually it was the only day we went on sightseeing in the city. 

We took the high speed train from HK to Shenzhen, after which we went to the hotel. By the way, the hotel is amazingly cheap! Though it's far from the city center, but it's hard to imagine you can book a 42$$m^2$$ room in a tree-star hotel with only 67 RMB(about 9 American dollars). 

It was in the afternoon that we started our trip. **Gundam Base(高达基地)** was our first destination(I'm not interested in Gundam, but my friend is).

Next to the Gundam Base was **Window of the World(世界之窗)**. Inside are miniature models of landmarks from around the world. But due to time constraints, we didn't go inside and just took some pictures at the entrance.

        <td><img src="pics\window2.jpg"></td>     
    </tr>     
</table>

Then was the **Tencent Building of Binhai(腾讯滨海大厦)**, which we chose as our next destination. It not a famous tourist attraction, but as a student majoring in CS, it should be a special spot for us to, well, take a visit. It's a high building with awesome design.

        <td><img src="pics\tencent2.jpg"></td>     
        <td><img src="pics\tencent3.jpg"></td>     
    </tr>     
</table>

Eager to see the "Ruddy Duck" in **Talent Park(人才公园)**. Pitifully, the duck was just removed two days ago, and what we've seen there was an empty park. 

<table>     
    <tr>       
        <td><img src="pics\park1.jpg"></td>       
        <td><img src="pics\park2.jpg"></td>     
        <td><img src="pics\park3.jpg"></td>     
    </tr>     
</table>

As night fell, we headed for  **Baoan Yantian Street Night Market(宝安盐田街夜市)**. It's a famous night market in Shenzhen, and its size is definitely large. The food is cheap there, for a single oyster will cost only 3 RMB.

    <tr>       
        <td><img src="pics\nightmarket1.jpg"></td>       
        <td><img src="pics\nightmarket2.jpg"></td>   
    </tr> 
    <tr>
        <td><img src="pics\nightmarket3.jpg"></td>     
        <td><img src="pics\nightmarket4.jpg"></td>     
    </tr> 
</table>

### Day2

Departure day! We almost spent the whole in airport. To be worse, the flight even delayed!
